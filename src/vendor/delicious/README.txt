DeliciousBrownies - PHP 5 class to access del.icio.us API
=========================================================
This class is a set of PHP functions to access del.icio.us web service API. Use this
class to easily manage your posts and do some other cool stuff on del.icio.us. Visit 
http://del.icio.us/nashruddin to see the result. I posted all of my blog's pages to 
del.icio.us using this class, taking the pages' <META NAME="keywords"> as the posts' 
tags.
